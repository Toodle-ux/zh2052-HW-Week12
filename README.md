Your goal is to light up all the stars
Select a type of click effect (e.g. cross, single, line, bomb). When clicking on the star, the star itself and the surrounding (if there are surrounding stars and your click effect covers them) will turn to the opposite color. 
But do be careful that the steps of each cilci effect are limited.

You can press space to restart each level.
